# sub2

sub2 is a subscriptions protocol for ERC20 tokens. The protocol is currently live on Base Sepolia. The code has not yet been audited, so use at your own risk. This code was originally a fork of the Permit2 project. More info will come soon. For now, you can read more [here](https://sub2.gitbook.io/sub2).
